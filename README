Wires is a PHP 5 library for doing dependency injection. Wires currently does 
constructor injection only. To learn all about inversion of control and 
dependency injection, have a look here:

ABOUT
~~~~~
Wires contains two main classes, the Injector and the Locator. The Locator is
responsible for defining what classes or objects should be instantiated where
and the Injector is responsible for building the objects. The two work in
concert to let you define dependencies and instantiate object graphs based on
those definitions.

Dependency definitions consist of a context, which is a class or interface
name, and a list of bindings. These bindings define how to instantiate the
constructor parameters of an object in that context. The contexts are 
hierarchical, so a binding defined in the context of an interface will apply
to all objects that implement that interface and similarly with abstract 
and base classes. There is also a global context that applies to all objects,
but the most specific context will always win out.

There are four different ways in which dependencies can be defined in the 
Locator:
  
    * Binding an interface or abstract class to a concrete class. This method 
      works with type-hinted parameters

    * Binding a parameter name to a class. This will instantiate a new object 
      of the class and assign it to that parameter. If that object has it's own
      dependencies, they will be filled in also and so on down the tree

    * Binding a parameter to a class as a singleton. This will instantiate a 
      single instance of the class and use it for every object in the context
      instead of instantiating a new one for each object created.

    * Binding a value to a parameter. This is a way to assign a value to a 
      parameter by name. It can be any value including primitives.


USAGE
~~~~~
The easiest way to create an instance of the Injector is to use the static 
method in the Wires class.

$injector = Wires::getInjector($bindings);

Here, $bindings is an array of binding definitions as described above. The 
structure of this array will be explained in the next section. After creating
the injector, you can then instantiate a class using the create() method.

$object = $injector->create('MyClassInterface');

A common usage pattern is to have an array of bindings that are always defined
for an application, but occasionally need to add additional bindings or 
overwrite ones that are already defined. In this case you can use the with()
method.

$object2 = $injector->with($other_bindings)->create('MyClassInterface');


BINDING DEFINITIONS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The structure of the $bindings array is a multi-level associative array. The 
first level is the name of the context. This can be an interface name, class
name or the global context which is named "_global". Under each context is 
another associative array where the keys are either a type-hint or a parameter
name. Here are some examples of each of the four definition types.

* Type Hinted
  array(
      '_global' => array(
          'MyClassInterface' => 'MyConcreteClass'));

* Parameter Name to Class
  array(
      '_global' => array(
          'param' => array('class' => 'MyConcreteClass')));

* Parameter Name to Singleton
  array(
      'OtherContext' => array(
          'param1' => array('asSingleton' => true, 'class' => 'MyConcreteClass')));

* Parameter Name to Value
  array(
      'OtherContext' => array(
          'param2' => array('value' => 1234)));

* All together
  array(
     '_global' => array(
         'MyClassInterface' => 'MyConcreteClass',
         'param' => array('class' => 'MyConcreteClass')),
     'OtherContext' => array(
         'param1' => array('asSingleton' => true, 'class' => 'MyConcreteClass'),
         'param2' => array('value' => 1234)));
